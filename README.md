## Introduction
Monte Carlo simulations offer a robust and versatile framework for understanding the complex dynamics of financial markets. Named after the famous casino in Monaco, this technique allows us to model uncertainty and make probabilistic forecasts. In the context of stock price prediction for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and ASML Holding N.V. (ASML), both of which are key players in the semiconductor industry, Monte Carlo simulations provide several advantages: Handling Complexity, Risk, Descision-making, and have a real-world calibration. 

Given the volatile nature of the technology sector and the high stakes involved in investment decisions, Monte Carlo simulations serve as an indispensable tool for investors and analysts alike. By employing this technique, one can gain nuanced insights into the future behavior of NVDA and ASML stocks, thereby making more informed investment decisions. However, it is important to note that this model is give some further inisights about the stock since real-world modeling requires other specific measures (Computational Power and Speed) to accurately describe the nature of the stock.
